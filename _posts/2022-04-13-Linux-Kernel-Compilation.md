## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have a good amount of free space. As for Virtual Machines, people had issues when they allocated only 20GB of storage space. So, allocate at least 50GB to avoid issues.

Install the following packages before moving to the next step:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc make bc build-essential libelf-dev libssl-dev bison flex initramfs-tools git-core libncurses5-dev dwarves zstd
```

<aside>
üí° In Sir Arif‚Äôs document, the `dwarves` and `zstd` packages were missing

</aside>

Now you can follow these steps. First, we‚Äôll compile the kernel and test that it‚Äôs running. Then we‚Äôll add our custom system call.

# Compiling Linux Kernel

## Step 1: Downloading source code and extracting

Download the kernel file from [www.kernel.org](http://www.kernel.org/) I would recommend downloading Linux Kernel 5.3.7 or a later version because the method of adding system calls described here is for kernel 5.3.7 or above.

For simplicity, you can download from this direct link (`Kernel 5.10.117`):

[https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.10.117.tar.xz](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.10.117.tar.xz)

if you are looking to download any other version, for simplicity you will need to download the tarball file, as shown in the picture below.

![1.jpeg](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-13-Linux-Kernel-Compilation-imgs/1.jpeg)

When you have downloaded the `linux-5.x.x.tar.xz` archive file, you need to extract it to a directory.

```bash
tar xvf linux-5.x.x.tar.xz #use correct file name
cd linux-5.x.x.tar.xz
```

Now you are in the directory of kernel files, which you can verify by listing the files using the `ls` command.

![2.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-13-Linux-Kernel-Compilation-imgs/2.png)

## Step 3: Configuration

Now, you need to configure your flavor of the kernel. Configuring the kernel involves selecting which features you want to build into the kernel image, which features you want to build as loadable modules, and which features you want to omit entirely. The configuration process will create a `.config` script for building the kernel. The `.config` file contains the configuration information for the kernel to be compiled.

There are different methods to configure the Linux kernel, but we‚Äôll use the configuration of the currently running kernel. Here, we‚Äôll copy the old configuration from `/boot/config-x.x.x-x-generic` and create a new `.config` file in our kernel‚Äôs directory.

like

```bash
cp /boot/config-5.13.0-40-generic ./.config
```

<aside>
üí° You may have more than one `config-x.x.x-x-generic` file, so to check which configuration is active, use `uname -r` and then copy that version of the generic file.

</aside>

Now in this .config file, we need to make some changes.

<aside>
üí° This step was missing in Sir Arif‚Äôs document.

</aside>

1. Open the .config file in vim.
2. Search for `CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS` and assign an empty string to it (i.e., double quotes`\"\"`)
3. Search for `CONFIG_SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS` and assign an empty string to it (i.e., double quotes`\"\"`)

![3.jpeg](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-13-Linux-Kernel-Compilation-imgs/3.jpeg)

1. Now, save the file and quit. `:wq!`

Now run the following command to configure:

```bash
yes '' | make oldconfig # it may take some time
```

You have now completed the configuration. However, you still need to distinguish your kernel from other versions. To do so, open the `Makefile` in the kernel‚Äôs root directory and change the `EXTRAVERSION` variable to something like this:

![4.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-13-Linux-Kernel-Compilation-imgs/4.png)

Now, to make a copy of the kernel release, run the following command:

```bash
make kernelrelease # after it succeeds, a kernel release will be printed, like 5.10.117-arm
```

## Step 4: Compiling the modules

Now it‚Äôs time to build/compile the kernel modules.

To do so, you can use the following commands:

```bash
make -j $(nproc) bzImage # nproc gives the number of your system's cores, and with this command, I am using all of my system's cores to make this process faster

# after the above command succeeds, run the following command.

make -j $(nproc) modules
```

## Step 5: Installing modules

Your kernel release has now been compiled. Now, to install the modules, use the following command. You need to be a sudoer for the installation process.

```bash
sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install

# INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 will reduce the size of the modules before installing them.
```

This step will take just a second to create a new directory, `/lib/modules/5.10.117-arm/`, and copy all the `.ko` files (modules) into it.

## Step 6: Installing kernel

Now, run the following command to install the custom kernel.

```bash
sudo make install
```

The `install` section of the `Makefile` will move the files to their destination locations, which are mentioned in the `DIR` variables (in the `Makefile`, like `BIN_DIR,` `MAN_DIR`, `BIN_DIR_D`, etc.). Instead of using the `mv` or `cp` command, the `install` target of the `Makefile` uses a Linux `install` command that not only moves files but also changes their permissions.

## Step 6: Updating the grub

Your kernel has now been compiled and installed. However, we still need to update the GRUB bootloader to boot our system from the custom kernel. For that, we need to increase the boot selection time to select our kernel. To do so, open the `/etc/default/grub` file in `vim` and change the `GRUB_TIMEOUT` value from 5 to 30.

Moreover, leave the `GRUB_DEFAULT` value as 0, which means that, by default, it will boot from the first kernel entry in the `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` file, which will be the newly installed kernel.

After making these changes, you need to update the bootloader using the following command:

```bash
sudo update-grub2
```

This will update GRUB with the new kernel. And if it is the latest kernel version, it will become the default to be loaded when rebooting. Otherwise, we need to explicitly select the kernel to run during the booting process. To open the bootloader, restart the system. During system startup, hold the Shift key, and you will see a screen with all installed kernels.

Congratulations, your kernel is ready to boot.

Restart your system to boot from the new kernel.

<aside>
üí° If you have a Linux OS as your host operating system and you have turned on Secure Boot, you might get an error while booting from your new kernel. To handle that error, you need to turn off Secure Boot and try to boot from your new kernel.

</aside>

```bash
sudo systemctl reboot
```

# Adding system call

We have now compiled and installed our configured Linux kernel release. Now it‚Äôs time to make actual changes in the kernel source code to have the satisfaction that we are actually making changes to the kernel.

This time, we‚Äôll just add our custom ‚Äúhello world‚Äù system call. 

<aside>
üí° Make sure that you have not booted from your custom kernel to follow these steps.

</aside>

## Step 1: Writing the systemcall code (`.c` file)

1. Create a C file in which you‚Äôll define your system call. For now, since we are just adding a ‚Äúhello world‚Äù system call, use these C files.

```bash
mkdir my_syscall # create this directory inside the Linux source root directory
cd my_syscall
touch hello_world.c
```

1. Add the following code snippet, as this is your custom system call code.

![5.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-13-Linux-Kernel-Compilation-imgs/5.png)

```c
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/syscalls.h>

SYSCALL_DEFINE0(hello_world) 
{
 printk("Hello Ali. This is me, your custom system call.\\n");
 // printk will print to the kernel log. See the man page for more details
 return 0;
}
```

1. Create a `Makefile` inside your system call‚Äôs directory and add the following line to it.

```bash
nvim Makefile
```

```makefile
obj-y := hello_world.o
```

## Step 2: Adding the header

We have now designed our system call. Now, we need to add and link this system call with our kernel.

```bash
nvim include/linux/syscalls.h

# add this line at the end of the file, just above #endif
asmlinkage long sys_hello_world (void);
```

We need to link our system call with the kernel‚Äôs `syscalls` header. To do so, add the following line at the end of `include/linux/syscalls.h`

## Step 3

Now, we need to register our system call in the `syscall` table to get a unique system call number. For this, open `arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl`

```bash
nvim arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
```

Add the following entry at the end of the file, where the last system call is registered. 

<aside>
üí° Remember to use a unique system call number in the 1st column of this table, and do not use the **reserved numbers**. The reserved numbers are already mentioned in this table file.

</aside>

For simplicity, I have used the number 696 for my system call.

![6.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-13-Linux-Kernel-Compilation-imgs/6.png)

<aside>
üí° In Sir Arif‚Äôs document, it was mentioned to add a prefix of _x64, but that will create problems while compiling. So far, I have been unable to find the exact answer to this problem and why it is an issue. ( if you find it, please let me know at my email address: bcsf19m513@pucit.edu.pk )

</aside>

```c
696 64 hello_world sys_hello_world
```

## Step 4

Now, we need to add our system call‚Äôs directory to the kernel source `Makefile`.

Open the `Makefile` and search for the `core-y` entry. 

At the end of this line, add the system call‚Äôs directory, followed by a space and a `/`. For simplicity, see the following picture.

![7.png](/assets/images/posts/2022-04-13-Linux-Kernel-Compilation-imgs/7.png)

```makefile
core-y += kernel/ certs/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ my_syscall/
```

## Step 5

Now, we need to recompile and install our kernel to test this system call. 

```bash
make -j $(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Use the following command to reboot, and hold the Shift key to select your custom kernel.

```bash
sudo systemctl reboot
```

<aside>
üí° Remember, this time you‚Äôll find a .old kernel file in the GRUB bootloader, but don‚Äôt boot from it; boot from your custom kernel.

</aside>

## Step 6

Now it‚Äôs time to test the changes that you have made to your own kernel release, i.e., testing the system call.

<aside>
üí° But remember, you must be booted from your own new kernel release. You can verify which kernel is running by using the `uname -r` command.

</aside>

Write a driver program anywhere in the system and test your system call.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>

int
main(){
 long rv = syscall(696); // 696 is my system call‚Äôs number
 if(rv == -1){ // it means no system call was found with the provided syscall number
 printf("error\\n");
 return -1;
 }
 return 0;
}
```

Since I have used `printk` to write output to the kernel log file, it won‚Äôt be printed on the shell/terminal. To check the kernel log, use `dmesg` and pipe it to `tail` to see the last entries after running the driver program. You‚Äôll find your system call‚Äôs output. This means your system call is working. 

Yes, you did it!

# Writing a wrapper function

We have successfully added and tested our system call on our custom kernel release. Now, we need to write a wrapper function for our system call. One of the advantages of doing this is that we do not need to remember the `syscall` number.

## Step 1: Write a wrapper function in a `c` file

You need to create a C file and then write a wrapper function in that file. I have created `greetings.c`

```c
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define SYSCALLNO 696

int hello(const char* name){
 printf("Hello %s!\\nYour message is displayed in the kernel log.\\nYou can use dmesg to read it.\\n\\nThank me later.\\n",name);
 long rv = syscall(SYSCALLNO);
 if (rv == -1){
 fprintf(stderr,"Error: Syscall Not found :(\\n");
 }
 return rv;
}
```

Now, I recommend that you create position-independent code (PIC) and create a dynamic library.

For that, you need to compile your code using the following command:

```bash
gcc -c -fPIC greetings.c
```

Now, create a dynamic library with the famous command.

```bash
gcc -shared greetings.o -o libgreetings.so
```

Now you have the `libgreetings.so` dynamic library. You can add this library to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` using:

```bash
sudo cp libgreetings.so /usr/lib
```

So far, so good. Now, you can write a driver program to test your wrapper function. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
 char name[20];
 scanf("%s", &name);
 int rv = hello(name);
 return rv;
}
```

And compile this code using:

```bash
gcc driver.c -o driver -lgreetings
```

And you are done.

# Writing the man page

By now, you might feel like, ‚ÄúOh yeah, I have my own system call; that seems professional.‚Äù But you have missed one thing during system call development.

To write a `man` page, you must have a good idea of the chapters of the `man` pages. Since system calls reside in chapter 2, you need to place the manual for your system call in `/usr/share/man/man2`, which is the directory for chapter 2 `man` pages for system calls.

The filename should be something like `functionName.2`, and in my case, it would be `greetings.2`.

Then, place your manual page entries like this:

```
.\" This is the manual page for a custom system call
.TH GREETINGS 2 "August 2022" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
 greetings \- Prints a greeting message to the kernel buffer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.sp
.BI int ("void");
.SH DESCRIPTION
This system call was written by Ali Raza to complete an assignment for System Programming at PUCIT.
It simply prints a greeting message
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.
.SH "MESSAGE"
To be honest, systems are awesome. Try to do some productive things by adding or updating things in the kernel.
Happy Learning with "Dr. Arif Butt"!
```

The last thing is to zip this file using the following command:

```bash
gzip greetings.2
```

Now your `man` page is ready. Since the `man` utility reads from the `/usr/share/man` directory for `man` pages, you also need to place it in this directory under the correct chapter. (In our case, it would be chapter 2, the system call‚Äôs `man` pages).

So, to do that,

```bash
sudo cp greetings.gz /usr/share/man/man2/
```

Now, try `man greetings`, and you‚Äôll find your `man` page.

And it‚Äôs DONE!

I hope this was an informative tutorial. 

Happy Learning and of course:
